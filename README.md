# United States Educational Attainment Choropleth Map

This project visualizes the percentage of adults aged 25 and older who have obtained a bachelor's degree or higher in the United States. The map displays this data on a county-level basis, using different shades of blue to indicate various education levels.

## Project Overview

The heatmap visualizes the global land-surface temperatures using a color gradient, where each cell represents a month's temperature anomaly. The x-axis displays the years, and the y-axis shows the months. A color scale is used to indicate temperature ranges, with cooler temperatures shown in blue and warmer temperatures in red. A legend and tooltips provide additional information about temperature values when a user interacts with the heatmap.

## Features
